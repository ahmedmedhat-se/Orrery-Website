GalacticPioneers - Orrery Web Application

-> IMPORTANT NOTES <-
  - Backend Files/Scripts Are Pushed To The Backend Branch
  - The Project Is'nt 100% Finished

Project Overview :
The "GalacticPioneers" team has developed an interactive "Orrery Web Application" that visually represents the Inner Solar System with a focus on Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) such as asteroids and Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs). 
The application combines modern frontend design with an immersive, 3D interactive model, delivering an educational and engaging experience for users to explore the cosmos.
This project is a part of our participation in the "NASA Space Apps Hackathon", and we are continually developing it with the aim of qualifying for the global competition.

Key Features :
- Interactive 3D Solar System Model: Built using Three.js and Tween.js, our model allows users to explore the inner solar system in real-time. It focuses on the orbits and positions of celestial bodies, including NEOs, offering a unique learning experience.
- Modern Frontend Design: Leveraging React.js and Bootstrap v5, we’ve created a sleek and user-friendly interface that simplifies navigation and interaction with the 3D model.
- Backend System & Data Management : Our backend system, built with Express.js and running on Node.js, is connected to a MySQL database for handling scientific data and user inputs. 
Postman has been used to rigorously test API requests to ensure data integrity and smooth user experiences.

- Scientific Contributions: In addition to the web app, we’ve produced three scientific research papers and a scientific abstract focused on :
  - The Inner Solar System
  - Near-Earth Objects (NEOs)
  - Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs)

Tools & Technologies :
- Frontend: React.js, Bootstrap v5, Three.js, Tween.js
- Backend: Express.js, Node.js
- Database: MySQL
- Design & UI/UX: Canva
- API Testing: Postman
- Version Control: Git/GitHub

Future Development :
While the application is still under development, we are continuously improving and refining its features. 
We aim to integrate more scientific data, enhance the user experience, and expand the scope of the educational material.

Team Vision :
Our vision is to combine technology with education to foster a greater understanding of our solar system, particularly the risks and wonders of Near-Earth Objects. 
Through this project, we hope to qualify for the global NASA Space Apps Hackathon and contribute meaningfully to space exploration education.
